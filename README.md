# spiking_network_criticality
Repo for building recurrent neural networks for modelling criticality. 



'admin functions' - functions for ordering and naming data

'cde net ictals' - network simulations for studying the effect of network topology (cycles) on avalance dynamics

'fish net' - network approximations for cellular resolution, meso and macro-scale networks

'net mod' - generative spiking network to model the role of network topology, network geometry and intrinsic excitability on seizure dynamics - built using scale free and small world networks

'net dyn' - simulating the effect of network topology on the dynamic range of the network
